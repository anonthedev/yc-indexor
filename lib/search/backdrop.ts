/**
 * A similarity score has no zero point: 0.256 means nothing on its own, which is why the ranking pipeline can only
 * ever say which image is *most* like the words, never which images *are* like the words. The way round it is to give
 * every image its own small multiple-choice quiz: the person's description against a fixed set of generic
 * descriptions. "Does `red or orange` describe this image better than these 25 other things?" has an answer, and the
 * answer means the same for every query, so one threshold works for all of them.
 *
 * The backdrop never changes, so each image's scores against it are worked out once and kept. A search then costs one
 * pass over numbers it already has.
